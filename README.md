A cross-platform client for Nostr showcasing [dart-nostr library](https://github.com/ethicnology/dart-nostr)


[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/dispute)

## Disclaimer
This app is in early development.  
Distributing an application is a cumbersome process where you have to fill out forms and wait a long time and sometimes pay (Apple, Microsoft and Googleâ€¦).  
Focusing on development, I will probably (when i will have some free time) release the app on Playstore (Android) and Snap store (Linux).  
I'm not a front-end dev that's why the design sucks.  

## Getting Started
This app can be build on many platform, please follow the guide:
- [Linux](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/linux)
- [Android](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android)
- [Web](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/web)
- [iOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/ios)
- [macOS](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/macos)
- [Windows](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/windows)

## Run
Clone the repository and inside the repository you can use:
```sh

flutter run 
```
